who am i?
=========

i spend lots of nights with my back to the floor. that's usually how i prepare for the next day. in a way, i like to picture myself watching the night sky while doing this. like i'm reaching beyond.

i'm working towards improving free culture, diversity, inclusion, free speech and private conversations. i like coloring stuff, singing out loud, building computer systems, martial arts, spaceships, nature and eating.

my name is sergio valverde but i go by toto when i'm being more honest with myself.

more?
=====

if you want to know a little bit more about me, send me an email to <vlvrdv@gmail.com> or read some of the [articles]({{< ref "/blog/archive/_index.md" >}}) i wrote before i started working on vlvrd.

i'm not that present on social media (narrowing posts to vlvrd updates and bad jokes like 'godzilla is dead - japanese nietzsche') but i'm at my most active at [twitter](https://twitter.com/vlvrdv). i also listen to stuff on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/vlvrdv), i'm taking my first [dev.to](https://dev.to/vlvrd) steps and work closely with [automata.network](http://automata.network/).

for my professional info, visit my not-updated [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-valverde-9058b971/) page or read [why you should hire me]({{< ref "/about/me/hire-me.md" >}}).
