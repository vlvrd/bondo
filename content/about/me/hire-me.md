why you should hire me
======================

i'm driven by the global need of a better and safer internet for everyone. it's been polluted to no end and i'm committed to help cleaning. if i work in an environment that aligns with that idea (even if the job doesn't involve saving the world), i'll always try to do my best.

i'm driven to learn and to help projects move forward. i also like helping people in any way i can.

although maybe you shouldn't
============================

if your company isn't invested in open source software or handles harassment cases poorly, i'm not interested.

my health is my priority: i can't work unless my body is doing ok. i have anxiety issues so i'd like to be able to work from home whenever i can and need to, but i wouldn't mind moving to another country.

i don't have a computer science background (i'm [studying](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) on my own tho but no college degree). i figure stuff pretty quickly but it might be a problem for you.

let's talk
==========

i'm currently working on cool projects with my current employer (low-level and kernel programming, embedded networking close-to-the-metal stuff) with modern tools and workflows (git, jenkins/travis, tdd) but i'm eager to learn more and work on open source exclusively.

so, if ((you want to meet me || would like to hire me) && you work on a cool company that will help me help [mozilla's mission](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/)) { i'm all :ear:s (and :eyes:) }.
