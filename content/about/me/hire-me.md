why you should hire me
======================

because i love what i do, and i do what i do to help others.

i have a background in electronic engineering and i also went to mechanical engineering school (though it's not something that i like anymore). i started coding when i was about 11, stopped early because i didn't understand databases (long story but i mean i wasn't a genius 11yo and needed something more interesting to work on). i started to play with microcontrollers as i was finishing my degree and fell in love with computer systems. from there i've been working with low-level code, embedded linux platforms, distributed memory technologies and, outside work environments, pretty much all software/hardware i could get my hands on.

i've been shifting my focus towards web technologies and distributed systems (not so much blockchains but mesh networks in general - i love ipfs - and, while i'm not even close to being an expert, i'm glancing nvdimms), while taking advantage of my hardware programming knowledge (hello, wasm and rust) to dream about products that will become much more accessible to everyone in browsers (hey, zeppelin and mozilla :grimacing:). especially once we get to a point where open hardware is also a thing (uhm, riscv).

this shift has two main reasons:
0. i think the way technology is growing in the world is misguided (this isn't just about computers, really). technologists should be more invested in the ethical consequences of their decisions. each change starts within ourselves and, well, i think the ethical thing for me to do is start investing myself in tech that will actually create a better world, not in tech that just fills privileged people's already filled pockets (i do want a good salary but you get my point).
1. it's harder for me to create tech art in my spare time with my embedded knowledge. i'm better suited to do so with front-end web tools for the time being - someday, i want to code my own interactive web experiences with my own drawings and my own music, on my own time. that's just a dream now but i want to start walking towards it, both in and out of work. and it has taken me too long already.

i'm also an interesting person (to my friends, at least). i'm a nerd in a lot of ways and i love being one. comic books, space stuff, movies of every kind and era, western and eastern animation, books (about everything), martial arts, yoga, swimming, hiking (the longer the hike, the better), DOGS, drawing and coloring stuff, discussing about computers a lot when someone's interested (stop discussing when someone's not), making music, sharing music, listening to music all day and knowing more about other people. i don't talk a lot, unless i really want to talk to someone (then, i can't seem to shut up), but you can always count on me as a listener.

you should hire me because, if you offer me a job and i say yes, it's because i'm motivated. i refuse to follow ego trips so i'm not saying any of this in an arrogant way: i know i'm not the best developer in the world and i'm not trying to be. i just want to help (you, me, everyone) and it's for that reason i'm trying my best to learn how to lead, how to improve and how to fail.

why you shouldn't hire me
=========================

i probably won't shut up. i mean, i'm shy and everything, but there are a couple of things that make me speak my mind: * when something interests me. i love learning, even if it doesn't relate to my current tasks. * when someone talks about the things i really like or shows me a picture of their mascot. * i took a stand years ago: i won't tolerate intolerance of any kind (someone once told me this attitude was me being a problem, and i respectfully disagreed: it's just me pointing to a problem) and i won't allow intolerance to go unnoticed in a team i'm working on. i'll try to do it in the most constructive manner but, you know, not a single person is able to create a cultural change alone.

unless there's a really compelling reason (and i don't think there is anymore), i won't do any close-sourced software again. i'm just not comfortable with making tech that makes money for the top 1% while neglecting the people that truly need solutions.

both my mental health and my physical health are my priority: i can't work unless my body is doing ok. i'm highly functional and i work hard, and while i have ocd and need some special accommodations (marked periods of no interruptions and a desk where i can actually focus on my tasks), i do great on what i do. but if this sounds like a problem, i guess we're not going to match properly.

i also don't have a computer science background (i'm [studying](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) on my own tho). it's not really a problem for me, since i'm used to figure stuff on the go and love to do so, but it might be a problem for you.

why we should collaborate
=========================

you see, i have a pretty great job as it is. even if i get frustrated sometimes by things i can't control in a big company, i'm working with people that i care about and that want to do their best. and i'm working on great projects (linux kernel, yocto, embedded stuff, hardware stuff) with modern tools and workflows (git, jenkins/travis, tdd). not everything is perfect but i'm still learning a lot here. but i guess that if you wait until you're truly stuck to take the next step, you're waiting too long.

i want to start doing open-source software that goes towards helping others. even if indirectly; i believe that in order to change the world you have to do it one commit at a time.

so, help me help you. if you're here, you're interested either in hiring me or in me staying where i am. and in both of those scenarios, i need you to tell me if you think i'd be a good fit, based on my technical skills and my soft skills when you get to know them but also on this i wrote.

because this is what truly motivates me: collaborating, in order to build a better world. and in order to do so, we should start being a little bit more honest with each other. this is me, taking the first step. work with me and tell me, from the start, who's your dream employee so we can realize if i'm the one. i'm interviewing you too.

and i know this pretty much blows my chances at a lot of places that would probably pay me a lot of money for coding close-sourced software in unhealthy environments, but i don't want to work in those places anyway so who cares. if you want me to work for you, let me tell you how i want to contribute to your work culture and let me see how my work will impact others.

if you read this and still want to contact me: i'm all :ear:s (and :eyes:).
