vlvrd is a space dojo.

wait.

i mean, not literally. but i want it to be.

...

let me start over.

vlvrd is me pursuing a dream.

ever since i can remember, i've wanted to live in a tree house to hang out in
secret when i needed a break.

that tree house eventually became an attic. a place where i could isolate myself
while i figured out how to be free, how to sing, dance, write and whatever
without anyone staring.

then, it became a spaceship. i wanted to take my home everywhere, just so i
could connect with other people and invite them over to the moon.

i needed to build a safe world for my mind. so i built an idea and i followed my
dream: a zen, but techy, playground that allowed me to create anything i could
think of that would mean something to me and to those i care about. somewhere
where i can be me and they can be them.

but if i'm about to connect with someone, i want she/he/they to feel safe in
this ship too, so this place has a few rules.

- we help one another.
- we collaborate.
- no discrimination. ever.
- no shoes.

now it's space dojo and you can practice your craft here without anyone judging.
if this doesn't fit you, i'll help you build your own.

i'll give you my blueprints, even. for free.

i'll just ask you to pay it forward if you do use them, since that's the whole
point of this.

but if we combine our ideas, who knows? we may end up with a real spaceship
someday. this place is not painted yet and i'll take any new ideas i can get.

that's not the goal yet, though. if this dojo is an imaginary spaceship, it
means we're exploring ourselves first.

what an adventure.
