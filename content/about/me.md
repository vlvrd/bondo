who am i?
=========

i spend lots of nights with my back to the floor. that's usually how i prepare for the next day. in a way, i like to picture myself watching the night sky while doing this. like i'm reaching beyond.

i'm working towards improving free culture, diversity, inclusion, free speech and private conversations.

i'm also bruce lee's reincarnation and an amateur space explorer.

my name is sergio valverde.

more?

if you want to know a little bit more about me, send me an email to <vlvrdv@gmail.com> or read some of the [articles]({{< ref "/about/archive/_index.md" >}}) i wrote before i started working on vlvrd. (• ◡•)

i'm not that present on social media (narrowing posts to vlvrd updates and bad jokes like 'godzilla is dead - japanese nietzsche') but i'm at my most active at [twitter](https://twitter.com/vlvrdv).

for my professional info, visit my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-valverde-9058b971/) page while i write a lil' something here.
