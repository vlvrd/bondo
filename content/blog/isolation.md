i love sunday mornings.

you can wake up early just because, grab a cup of coffee without minding the clock and (let me paint you a picture) you get to warm yourself by walking if it's a cold morning.

you can even step outside of your house without your headphones blocking the rest of the world, because you feel safer.

you'll probably use your headphones if you're in the city, though. you never know who you'll run into.

it's a perfect moment to take out your masks and feel at home with yourself.

i hate saturday nights.

you're just laying on the floor trying to remember how to catch a breath while browsing through books, movies and social media, maybe waiting for a text that will only make you feel worse, or surrounded by people who don't really care what you have to say. in any case you're floating in and out of reality, trying to cope with loneliness.

it's scary to you to confront yourself and the choices you've made that have led to this. it's even scarier to do so and find that the other side is just as lonely.

self-imposed isolation is an introvert's way of not dealing with feeling ignored all the time.

i love sunday mornings - i hope i'll learn to love saturday nights as well.
