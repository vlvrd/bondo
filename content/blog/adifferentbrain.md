*"ok, but have you ever wanted to kill yourself?"*

it's not like i ever **intended** to kill myself. it's just that, sometimes, it feels like you run out of choices.

i have ocd
----------

it feels weird to say that. sometimes i still think it's not true. obsessive compulsive disorder is an anxiety disease that's wildly mischaracterized and it's probably very different from what you'd expect it to be. i've never felt the need to wash my hands 50 times before i leave my appartment or anything like that.

if you have ocd, you're constantly trying to fix your thoughts. it isn't completely understood by science yet - from what i've read, an ocd brain corrupts the sensory data on it's way to the cerebral cortex. from there, everything gets interpreted as a threat.

even your wildest ideas.

it's a negative loop: something triggers you, you get a bizarre idea, you obsess over it, you start to self monitor and doubt yourself, you try to not think about it (which makes it worse) and then you come up with rituals that make you feel safe - that may or may not show up in the surface. then, you try to avoid the trigger, either by running away from it or by repeating the rituals, effectively closing the loop of compulsion.

when untreated, since everything's a menace for you, there's constant fear. you can't avoid it since your brain has a hard time realizing that nothing bad is going to happen if you step out of your mental routine. intrusive thoughts have a way of attaching themselves to the things you care about the most, so it's disturbing to think about all of the times you imagine yourself harming those you love. and when you do (which is a normal part of life i guess), you start to hate yourself, because you know (even if it isn't true) that you're putting them in danger. it makes you a bad friend.

to a degree, everyone has intrusive thoughts. and everyone has obsessions and compulsions. they can manifest daily in everyone's life. that's not it. it's the disorder part what gets to you.

it's that those thoughts, obsessions and compulsions matter way too much.

it's how it feels
-----------------

what i'm saying is i can't truly explain it to you. but it's painful, it's real and it's scary. you live in fear of bad things happening because of you.

it becomes a downwards spiral. you start doubting everything because you can't trust your memories and you feel guilty about every little thing, and all of that builds into a load that no one can withstand. you see, genes and traumas can cause this disorder, but when you have this burden and you don't unload it, it starts to affect your life in every possible way.

trying to bottle everything i felt just made everything worse. i developed paranoia, disociation and depression because of it. a lot of the time i just thought i could carry this pain inside of me and protect everyone i care about from me. and i thought that if i couldn't, i'd just find a way to die and make it seem like it was an accident.

what a fucking idiot.

i didn't really want to die, but most of the time i just wanted the pain to stop and keep everyone safe from me.

making lemonade
---------------

everyone's brain is amazing. even mine. especially mine, maybe. it can rewire itself and can fix the circuits if treated correctly.

but still, it's going to be a lifelong struggle. there's so much biological predisposition to fall back to the unhealthy loops so it's not something that can be left unchecked. ever. the solution is simple, but it takes massive motivation to go through with it: exposure therapy and medication. take a stand against your obsessions and you'll eventually realize that you don't need to go through your compulsions because none of your ideas are real. only you can break the loop, but it takes a while.

in a way, i was lucky. i've always had access to professional help, even when i was keeping all of this to myself. in other ways, an unstable brain feels like the dealer handed you a shitty hand. it used to feel unfair, because it wasn't my fault that i was born this way: shorter, struggling to be heard, mentally unbalanced, surrounded by people who felt entitled to have a say in my life and to lay their fists in my face. but, you know, everyone's dealing with their own personal demons and the world goes on.

so go harder.

i shined so my grandparents were proud of me. i achieved success in things i felt i wasn't supposed to, because i wanted to prove everyone was wrong about me. what i didn't know is that i was also wrong about me - i'm not a bad person, i was just brain sick living in unhealthy environments. standing here, today, is my greatest achievement. and believe me: it's the hardest thing i've ever done.

having a different brain makes me awesome at a lot of things, the struggle taught me empathy and i'm learning how to be a better friend. i'm still gonna fuck up sometimes and i still think that i'm broken and damaged, but that only means i'm human. if you're trying your best, you can cut yourself some slack.

*"ok, but have you ever wanted to kill yourself?"*
--------------------------------------------------

yes.

i've also taken the first step in a two-step plan to do so.

but i didn't, because i realized no one has say in what i do. not even my worst thoughts.

somewhere along the way i decided to get better and i reached out for help, so i'm doing great. i now live a slow life, and i'm more productive because of it. if i'm gonna obsess compulsively about something, i'll focus on my own goals.

i'm turning my disability into a superpower, because that's the only way this is going to work: only by helping yourself you're able to help others.

i own my life. and you own yours too.
